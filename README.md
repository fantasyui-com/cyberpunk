# cyberpunk
A cyberpunk music generator, inspired by a game-loop based drum machine.

Cyberpunk emphasizes portable JSON output,
it requires a music encoder (ex. electron WebAudio based generator).
The song format stores milliseconds to help your encoder place/queue the sounds.

see index.js for song example and [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder) for encoder example.
